## ‚öñÔ∏è TOS & Regulations Analyzer

The **TOS & Regulations Analyzer** is a Flask-based web application designed to quickly process and analyze lengthy legal documents like Terms of Service (TOS) and Privacy Policies using modern Machine Learning and OCR techniques.

### ‚ú® Key Features

  * **AI Summarization:** Generates a concise, abstractive summary of the legal text using a specialized Hugging Face **DistilBart model** (`ml6team/distilbart-tos-summarizer-tosdr`), making complex terms readable.
  * **Risk Assessment:** Provides a quick-view safety score and categorized risk scores (e.g., Privacy, User Rights) based on analysis heuristics.
  * **Aggressive Language & Clauses:** Highlights suspicious wording and problematic clauses detected in the text.
  * **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** Allows users to input text by uploading an image or taking a photo (via a webcam) using **Tesseract** to extract the text.

## üèÉ Local Setup (General)

To run this application locally, you'll need Python, Tesseract, and the required Python libraries.

1.  **Install Tesseract OCR:** Tesseract must be installed on your operating system and added to your system's PATH.
2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/TOS-Analyzer.git
    cd TOS-Analyzer
    ```
3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Assuming you have created a `requirements.txt` with all imported libraries: `Flask, nltk, sumy, transformers, pillow, pytesseract`)*
4.  **Run the Flask Application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
5.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

*(**Note:** This general instruction assumes the core logic has been separated into `app.py` and the HTML into `templates/index.html` as is standard practice for Flask.)*

# ConsenSure: The Digital Textbook
This project is a simple web application that summarizes legal text (like Terms of Service) using a large language model. It's designed to be easy to run and share.

Files
The project consists of three main files:

index.html: The main structure of the web page, including all the HTML elements.

style.css: The styles for the page, using Tailwind CSS.

script.js: The JavaScript logic for handling user input, making the API call, and displaying the results.

How to Access and Deploy
To run this application, you only need to host these three files on a web server.

Clone the repository: If you are a collaborator or have access, you can clone the project from GitHub.

git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/consensure_team_extropy.git](https://github.com/your-repo/consensure_team_extropy.git)

Open the files: Navigate to the project directory.

Deploy: You can deploy this application using any static hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. All of these services can connect directly to your GitHub repository and automatically deploy the web page for you. Alternatively, you can simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

Once deployed, anyone with the link will be able to access the web application and use it to summarize documents.
